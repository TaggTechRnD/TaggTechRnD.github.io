The same cognitive processes which a musician uses to combine single notes into chords and sequences of notes into melodies can be used to teach a martial artist how to bring together body movements into techniques and sequences of movements into training routines and kickboxing combinations. The same approaches teachers use to build scientific or mathematical understanding can be used to build creativity and innovation. The name of the game is **interdisciplinarity**, and it's more than just a buzzword or a hobby. Interdisciplinary approaches to business, technology, health and fitness are the untapped resource we (as a society) have ignored. 

### But why is that?

Look up any job description on your favourite job searching website, and likely you will look for two sections before all others: "Required Skills" and "Preferred Skills". And this makes total sense, right? Most jobs have absolute requirements, without which the job would be impossible. Except nowhere does it say in the description *"The successful candidate will exhibit competency in multiple forms of intelligence, proving their ability to bring new perspectives and skillsets into the position and providing evidence of a greater variety of learning processes."* If you find one, let me know.

**Myth**: *The Jack/Jill of all trades is the master/mistress of none*

At the time of writing, I can:
- Speak 2 languages fluently, and a few more at a conversational level
- Teach classes in 3 different martial arts and join in with 8 others
- Teach college courses in multiple subjects
- Design advanced structures in CAD, then 3D print them. 
- Design and conduct complex research experiments, often with human participants
- Code in 2 different programming languages (currently learning 2 more)
- Coach strength, conditioning, performance and functional movements 
- Run simulations and inferential statistics on massive datasets
- Play 3 musical instruments at the professional level

And I have no intention of stopping. Being good at a lot of things **is not** a flaw. It does not make you unreliable or flaky, it does not mean you get bored easily. We need to rid ourselves of the belief that being able to transfer how we learn one skill to any other is somehow a threat to growth or productivity. 

## Can you adjust your focus?:

People with the ability to transfer learning methods from skill to skill are capable of viewing business and social problems on every level of the socio-economic and socio-ecological models. They can see the interactions between individuals, between departments, between businesses and between governments.
