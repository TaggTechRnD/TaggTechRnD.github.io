subtitle: The basic tour of what I'm all about
---

My name is Adam, I'm from the UK but living in the USA. 
I'm currently a PhD student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and when that is completed I will be looking for something which can put together all of the skills and interests which are the glue keeping me together. 

If you want a conversation on any of the following topics:
- Martial Arts
- Exercise/fitness
- Engineering (in all forms)
- Linguistics
- Skill Development
- Cognition/Neuroscience
- Economics
- Design
- Outdoors/camping
- Cryptography
- Data Science
- App development
- In fact, science in general...
- ... that includes science fiction
- Woodworking
- aaaand, Archery

... then you will find a willing and enthusiastic conversation partner in me. I'm usually using 6 of these in any given week of my lab work and research.

### Martial Arts

Even though it's been a long, long time since I made it, you can see [my old youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXYkusj0XtAbADC008OsnDQ) and it should give you a basic idea of what kind of martial arts I do and what prompted me to leave my old job as a full-time martial arts and fitness instructor in order to move around the world (not for the first time) to study (again, not for the first time) a completely new discipline (again, not the first time, you get the picture) and get my PhD (ok, that one is a first).
